# Biostatistics and Health Data Analysis using R

This repository contains R scripts and reports for various biostatistical analyses conducted as part of the course "Learning R for Applied Statistics in Health Data Science." Each query focuses on hypothesis testing, probability calculations, ANOVA, and data visualization using datasets such as North Carolina Birth Data, hemoglobin data in anemic and non-anemic children, and the red blood cell count of patients. The analyses aim to extract meaningful insights about maternal health, birth outcomes, and hemoglobin levels in children.


## Roadmap

## Query 1: Descriptive Statistics and Visualization

Objective: 

Perform descriptive statistical analysis and visualization on birth weight data (TGRAMS, TOUNCES) to examine distribution, skewness, and differences based on smoking status.

Tasks:

Compute mean, median, standard deviation, IQR, range, skewness, and kurtosis.

Construct histograms and box plots to visualize distribution.

Compare the birth weight distributions of smokers vs. non-smokers using side-by-side boxplots.

Provide a statistical summary and interpretation of the results.


## Query 2: Probability and Normal Distribution Calculations

Objective: 

Perform probability calculations using the NCBIRTH800 dataset.

Tasks:

Construct a contingency table for smoking status and premature birth (PREMIE vs. SMOKE).

Compute conditional probabilities related to smoking and birth outcomes.

Analyze the distribution of maternal age (MAGE) using the normal distribution.

Generate histograms and box plots for MAGE.

Compute confidence intervals using the empirical rule.


## Query 3: Confidence Interval Estimations

Objective: 

Estimate confidence intervals using a simple random sample (SRS) of 50 from NCBIRTH800.

Tasks:

Compute 95% confidence intervals for proportions and means of:

Male birth proportion.

Mother's age at birth.

Weight gain during pregnancy.

Smoking vs. non-smoking mothersâ€™ weight gain.

Birth weight differences between married vs. unmarried mothers.

Low birth weight proportions for married vs. unmarried mothers.

##Query 4: Hypothesis Testing on Hemoglobin Data (HEMOGLOB)

Objective: 

Compare hemoglobin levels between anemic and healthy children using hypothesis testing.

Tasks:

Select an SRS of 80 from each population (anemic vs. healthy children).

Perform outlier detection (Grubbs test) and remove outliers.

Conduct a two-sample t-test (Î± = 0.05) to test for differences in mean hemoglobin levels.

Interpret p-values, confidence intervals, and assumptions of the test.

## Query 5: One-Way ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s HSD Analysis (RBCDATA)

Objective: 

Analyze differences in RBC data across three groups (GOOD, FAIR, POOR) using ANOVA.

Tasks:

Select an SRS of 80 from each group.

Conduct outlier analysis.

Perform one-way ANOVA and Tukeyâ€™s post hoc test.

Report p-values, F-statistic, R-squared, and interpret group differences.
